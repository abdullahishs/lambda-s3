# Rapha Engineering Task

This repository hosts documentation and starter code for the coding tasks we use in the Engineering team interview process at Rapha. The task is designed to resemble features or problems that we would tackle as part of our day-to-day, so that you can get a sense of what it's like here.

As always we'd love to hear any questions or comments you might have around the process.

## Introduction

This technical exercise is designed to evaluate your proficiency in deploying and configuring AWS code. It will also test your approach to monitoring and deployments.

### Objective

Your main objectives are to:

* Deploy the zip file built in package.json as an AWS lambda, build an S3 bucket and configure the connection between the two.
* Configure an alert for when the lambda errors, and build out any other monitoring you see fit.
* Document the build processes for others to follow.

### What We Are Expecting

This is a test of your approach and how you implement DevOps principles. You are not expected to change the code in handler.ts as it should work with the correct configuration in Lambda. The priority is deploying infrastrcture and then ensuring that infrastructure is stable.
